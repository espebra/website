[Filebin.net](http://filebin.net) was created to try out the new [File API](http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/) features in HTML5.

Filebin is a web application that is somewhat similar to a pastebin, except that it's for files. It is written in Python, and the code is available on [Github](http://github.com/espebra/filebin).
