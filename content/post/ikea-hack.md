Background
----------

At work I have a couple of desktop monitors which I use with my laptop. These monitors are placed directly on my desk and are, in my opinion, too low compared to my eye level. If I raise the desk (yes, it is one of these fancy electric ones) to the appropriate level for the eyes, the desk gets too high for my arms. I considered simply placing the monitors on some cardboards boxes, but decided to pick up something from IKEA instead to make a custom tabletop table.

Eh, none.

Setup

This is straight forward. I used a [router](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(woodworking\)) to hollow out some space for the legs' mounting plates, in an attempt to make the mounting plates invisible when the table is in upright position. I just happend to have a lot of glue, so I obviously applied a lot of it when fastening the mouning plates. This thing will never fall apart!

One leg fastened. Repeat, repeat and repeat - and the tabletop table to be suddenly has four legs.

The wireless charger I bought is designed to be built into furniture, so it should be a good fit for my mini project. However, it is probably a better fit when the back of the charger can be hidden inside something. Since my tabletop table is relatively thin, the back of the charger will be clearly visible. That will not look good, but I rate wireless charging higher than the looks in this case.
